# SEWA 2026 Backend

Node + Express + TypeScript + PostgreSQL (via Prisma) backend for the SEWA 2026
registration portal.

## Flow

```
POST /api/auth/signup           -> create account (unverified)
POST /api/auth/otp/send         -> (re)send email OTP
POST /api/auth/otp/verify       -> verify OTP, activates account, sets session cookie
POST /api/auth/signin           -> sign in, sets session cookie
POST /api/auth/signout          -> clear session
GET  /api/auth/me               -> current user
POST /api/auth/password/forgot  -> send a password-reset OTP
POST /api/auth/password/reset   -> consume the OTP, set a new password

GET  /api/profile               -> current user + candidate profile (null until saved)
PUT  /api/profile               -> full-replace upsert of the "Personal Details" step

POST   /api/register                           -> create team (leader = current user)
GET    /api/register/me                        -> current user's team + members
PATCH  /api/register/:teamId                   -> edit a draft team's name/institute/theme/PS
POST   /api/register/:teamId/members           -> add a member (no account required)
DELETE /api/register/:teamId/members/:memberId -> remove a member
POST   /api/register/:teamId/submit            -> lock and submit the team

GET  /api/health                -> liveness + database connectivity
```

All `/api/register/*` and `/api/profile` routes require a signed-in,
**email-verified** user.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # fill in real values — see below
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
npm run dev
```

### Required env vars (see `.env.example`)

- `DATABASE_URL` — Postgres connection string. Needs the `citext` extension
  (`CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS citext;` — Prisma's `postgresqlExtensions`
  preview feature declares this in `prisma/schema.prisma`, but you may need
  DB-level permission to create extensions depending on your host).
- `JWT_SECRET` — 32+ random characters. Generate with
  `openssl rand -base64 48`.
- `SMTP_*` — real SMTP credentials for sending OTP emails. For a govt
  deployment, use an institutional or verified transactional-email provider
  (not a personal Gmail account) so deliverability and SPF/DKIM are sane.
- `CLIENT_ORIGIN` — exact origin of the frontend (e.g.
  `https://sewa2026.dtu.ac.in`). CORS is locked to this one origin with
  credentials enabled.

## What's deliberately NOT here yet

- **Rate limiter store** — uses in-memory `express-rate-limit`. If you
  deploy more than one instance behind a load balancer, swap in
  `rate-limit-redis` (limits won't be shared across processes otherwise).
- **Admin/review endpoints** — nothing here handles jury review,
  shortlisting, or exporting registrations. `team.status` already has the
  states (`under_review`, `shortlisted`, `rejected`) for this to build on.
- **Member identity linking** — if a team member (added as plain data) later
  signs up with a matching email, nothing auto-links their `TeamMember.userId`.
  Intentional per the design discussion — auto-linking on email match isn't
  safe identity verification for a govt system. Build an explicit
  invite/claim-token flow if you want members to later access their own
  team's data.
- **Team-size limits** (`TEAM_MIN_MEMBERS` / `TEAM_MAX_MEMBERS` in
  `src/schemas/team.schema.ts`) are placeholders (2–6) — set them to SEWA
  2026's actual rules.
- **Tests** — none included.

## Verifying before you deploy

`prisma generate` couldn't fully complete in the sandbox this was built in
(no network access to Prisma's engine binaries), so the Prisma-generated
enum/model types (`OtpPurpose`, `TeamMember`, etc.) weren't present during
typecheck here. Run `npx prisma generate` locally — you should get a clean
`npx tsc --noEmit`.
